## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with: Alden Cowap
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW so far: 4 hours
* The URL of the RPubs published URL [http://rpubs.com/egoins/hw2](https://www.nhl.com/).
* What gave you the most trouble: Figuring out how to use shiny
* Any comments you have: I really appreciate the advice on the line for women, because I think it helped to elucidate trends in the data. 



## Question 1:

Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the `profiles` data set,
specifically on the relationship between gender and

* `income`
* `job`
* `smoking`

all keeping in mind in HW-3, you will be fitting a logistic regression to
predict a user's gender based on these variables.

Notes:

* **INCOME**: In the first graph, I have excluded most of the outliers so that you can see that females make, on average, less than men. Also, as seen in the second graph, the percentage of woman in each graph is less than the percentage of women on OkCupid. This is most extreme in the higher brackets, such as 250000 and 500000. The last graph shows the proportion of males and females who did not respond, and about 80% of the females did not respond to income. A higher proportion of men did respond to the income question, and this may be responsible for the trends seen in graph 2. 

* **JOB EXPLORATION**: This graph shows the proportionality of males to females that are in each type of job. Women have the highest proportion of jobs, in medicine/health, clerical/administrative, and education/academia. Men are found mostly in jobs such as science/tech/engieneeering, construction/craftsmanship, and computer/hardware/software. This is further reinforced by the line showing the proportion of women on OkCupid. The disparity here aligns with commonly-held beliefs regarding gender roles. I included the proportionality of men/women who answered NA, and it seems that a slightly higher proportion of women answered NA relative to their representative proportion in the profiles data set.

* **SMOKES**: I chose to look at smoking as the third variable to compare with gender because smoking is stigmatized. It is also more socially acceptable for men to smoke and use tobacco than women, because it is seen as "unlady like." The first graph shows the proportionality of males/females who answered in each "smokes" category, and women are under-represented in every category except "no," confirming my suspicions that there are fewer women who smoke, or at least who are willing to report that they smoke. I also included a second graph to look at the general distribution of smokers for each sex. I categorized "trying to quit", "when drinking", and "sometimes" as yes because it means that they at least occasionally smoke. This graph shows that, by far, most males and females do not smoke.

## Question 2:

In the file `HW-2_Shiny_App.Rmd`, build the Shiny App discussed in Lec09 on
Monday 10/3: Using the `movies` data set in the `ggplot2movies` data set, make a
Shiny app that

* Plots budget on the x-axis and rating on the y-axis
* Instead of having a radio button to select the genre of movie (`Action`,
`Animation`, `Comedy`, etc), have a radio button that allows you to toggle
between comedies and non-comedies. This app should be simpler.
